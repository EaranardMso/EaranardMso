Hi, I'm Earanard. I'm a High School student, currently learning computer science. This is my personal git-hub repository, and it will contain any and all code that I'm working on, either personally or for class. Most of this repository is private, and I'm honestly not sure how you found me, but here I am.

### Interests
- Computer Science
- Data Science
- Networking
- 3D Modeling
- Engeneering

- Windows (Power Use)
- WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)
- Linux (currently using PopOs on my "desktop" a thinkpad p15s)
